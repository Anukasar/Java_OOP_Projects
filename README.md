## 📁 Projects Included

### 1. 🧑‍⚖️ AgeValidation

A simple project to validate if a user's age and bank balance meet required criteria.

### 2. 🧠 EntityManager

A structured application demonstrating **inheritance** and **class hierarchy** to manage different types of people such as:

- `Teacher`
- `Manager`
- `HOD`
- `Student`
- `FullTimeEmployee`
- `PartTimeEmployee`

#### ✨ Features

- Eliminates redundancy using **inheritance**
- Handles multiple person types in a unified structure
- Uses **composition** for managing address information
- Demonstrates **method overriding** and **abstraction**

#### 📌 Concepts Covered

1. Inheritance & Polymorphism  
2. Abstract Classes  
3. Encapsulation  
4. Constructor Chaining  
5. Java Class Hierarchies
